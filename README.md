# Kubescape-network-scanner
A network and service discovery package in golang for scanning networks inside kubernetes clusters and finding hidden services. This project is an extension of the Kubescape platform and aims to provide comprehensive network scanning capabilities within Kubernetes environments.

## Key Features
- **No Port Mapping Approach**: Unlike traditional scanners, Kubescape Network Scanner does not rely on port mapping for service discovery. It can uncover hidden services running on different ports, providing a more comprehensive scanning experience.

- **Discover Hidden Services**: Kubescape Network Scanner excels at finding hidden services that may go unnoticed by other scanners, enabling you to identify potential blind spots within your Kubernetes clusters.

- **Authentication Check and Exposed Services Detection**: Kubescape Network Scanner allows you to verify if services are properly authenticated and provides insights into exposed services, helping you mitigate potential risks proactively.
